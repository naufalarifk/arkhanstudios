          <p className="lg:text-left text-center">
            A mascot is any human, animal, or object thought to represent a
            group with a common public identity, such as a school, professional
            sports team, society, military unit, or brand name. Mascots are also
            used as fictional, representative spokespeople for consumer
            products. In sports, mascots are also used for merchandising. Team
            mascots are often related to their respective team nicknames. This
            is especially true when the team's nickname is something that is a
            living animal and/or can be made to have humanlike characteristics.
